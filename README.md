Tarefa para Data Scientist's Toolbox
Instruções

The Course Project for this course is pretty straightforward. Now that you’ve learned about the basic tools found in the data scientist’s toolbox, we want to make sure that you’ve assembled those tools and are ready to begin using them. This easy project is your chance to demonstrate that you’ve done the basic software setup (R, RStudio, and Github) that will get you through the rest of the Data Science Specialization.

Review criteriamenos 
After you submit your work, your classmates will evaluate your submission by answering a series of yes/no questions about your work. You are also required to evaluate at least four of your classmates’ submissions.
